# TikTok Project I: Inspect and analyze data**

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided. We will:

1.   Get to know the data.

2.   Compile summary information about the data

3.   Begin the process of EDA and reveal insights contained in the data


*This project can be divided in three parts:*

**Part 1:** Understand the situation
* How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided TikTok information?

**Part 2:** Understand the data

* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning and future exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical activities

* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3:** Understand the variables

* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables
